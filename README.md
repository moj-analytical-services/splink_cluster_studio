## Splink Cluster Studio

### Aim

Splink Cluster Studio takes the output of [Splink](https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/splink) and creates an interactive html dashboard that allows you to visualise and analyse a sample of clusters from your record linkage.

The html file is self-contained, with all required javascript inlined, meaning that it works offline in any modern web browser just by double clicking the file.

### Demo

A live demo of how dashboards can be created can be found in the [splink_demos](https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/splink_demos) repo.
